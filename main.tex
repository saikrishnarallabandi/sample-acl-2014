\begin{abstract}
This paper is a test of the emergency broadcast system. This paper is
only a test. In the event that this were a real paper, upon attempts to
print it your printer would immediately self-destruct in a ball of fire and
mysterious Hebrew letters portending doom would appear etched in the burnt
plastic. Again, this paper is only a test.
